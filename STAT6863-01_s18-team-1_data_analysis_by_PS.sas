Question: Does offense win more games than defense?

Rationale: Defense has always been known to win chamionships but modern day NBA 
focuses more on offense than defense.

Note: This question will see how wins are won by comparing points, assists 
offensive rebounds as offense, defensive rebounds, steals, and blocks as 
defense. team_box_score and player_stats

Limitations: Dataset 1 (player_stats) is on player level data for 2014-2015
season, whereas dataset 2 (team_box_score) is on a team level data for 2016-2017
season. I will need to focus on the team level in order to answer my research
question. There is no way to join between the two tables. If there was a way,
both datasets are in two different seasons which would need to be stated in 
order to answer my research question.

Question: Which position is the most important for a championship caliber team?

Rationale: NBA teams have built their teams around centers, guards, or forwards.
But which position provided the most help in winning a championship.

Note: This question will look at shots made, total rebounds, and total
assists and how it has contributed to championship wins. team_box_score and
player_stats

Limitations: Since dataset 1 and dataset 2 cannot be joined without additional
information (i.e. team each player was on during the 2014-2015 season). Another
limitation to note is the different seasons each dataset refers to, 2014-2015 
and 2015-2016, respectively.

Question: Is wingspan an effective measurement of an average double digit 
scorer?

Rationale: Sam Hinkie, previous GM of the Philadelphia 76ers, looked at 
physical and athletic traits in order to predict a "superstar" player. One of 
those traits was wingspan.

Note: This question will look at average double digit scorer in the NBA and 
compare their wingspan. player_stats and player_anthro

Limitations: Dataset 3 (player_anthro) only contains data on rookie NBA players
who participated in the NBA combine. Using dataset 3, I will be able to see
only rookie players who participated in the combine for 2014-2015.
