;

footnote1 justify=left
"On average, in 2015, offensive rebounds are greater than defensive rebounds. The average offensive rebounds per game range from 0 to 14.8 in 2015 and the average defensive rebounds per game range from 0 to 10.3 in 2015."
;

*
Note: This question will see how wins are won by comparing points, assists 
offensive rebounds as offense, defensive rebounds, steals, and blocks as 
defense. team_box_score and player_stats

Limitations: Dataset 1 (player_stats) is on player level data for 2014-2015
season, whereas dataset 2 (team_box_score) is on a team level data for 
2016-2017 season. I will need to focus on the team level in order to answer 
my research question. There is no way to join between the two tables. 
If there was a way, both datasets are in two different seasons which would 
need to be stated in order to answer my research question.

Methodology: Use proc report to show the first ten observations of the 
data. Then create quartiles using proc rank and see the frequency using
proc freq. Finally use proc means to see the averages in offensive and
defensive rebounds.

Followup Steps: Clean missing data values for find additional data to 
fill missing values. Possibly add more years to the data.

Limitations: Since dataset 1 and dataset 2 cannot be joined without additional
information (i.e. team each player was on during the 2014-2015 season). Another
limitation to note is the different seasons each dataset refers to, 2014-2015 
and 2015-2016, respectively.

Methodology: Use proc sql to check the first ten observations in the data.
Create quartiles using proc rank and proc freq to see the frequency of FG 
percentage. Then use proc means to use as a benchmark when comparing the FG
percentage by position.

Followup Steps: Clean the position data to show only one position instead of
combinations.

title2 justify=left
"Rationale: Sam Hinkie, previous GM of the Philadelphia 76ers, looked at physical and athletic traits in order to predict a superstar player. One of those traits was wingspan."

*
Note: This question will look at average double digit scorer in the NBA and 
compare their wingspan. player_stats and player_anthro

Limitations: Dataset 3 (player_anthro) only contains data on rookie NBA players
who participated in the NBA combine. Using dataset 3, I will be able to see
only rookie players who participated in the combine for 2014-2015.

Methodology: Use proc corr to examine the correlation between FG percentage
and wingspan. Then create a scatterplot to get a visual relationship between
the two variables.

Followup Steps: Carefully clean missing values in order to ensure valid 
results. Possibly add more years to the data to get a stronger result.
